# Feedforward Neural Network

# Guidelines
# A fully connected feedforward neural network (from lecture 14), trained by
# backpropagation, where the network architecture (number of nodes / layers),
# learning rate and termination are determined by cross-validation. This method
# must be fully implemented by your team, and corresponding code submitted.

# Note to TA
# Please note that the below code was inspired by the 3-layer neural network
# Python guide found here:
# http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/
# as well as the COMP 551 lecture 14 notes found here:
# http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/comp551/Lectures/14NeuralNets.pdf
